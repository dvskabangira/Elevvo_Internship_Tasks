# Student Performance Factors (Kaggle Dataset)
# Build a model to predict students' exam scores based on their study hour
# Perform data cleaning and basic visualization to understand the datase
# Split the dataset into training and testing set
# Train a linear regression model to estimate final score
# Visualize predictions and evaluate model performance
